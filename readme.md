# Day 23 Task | Cohort 2.0

This project is a dynamic and responsive image collage dedicated to the illustrious career of **Mahendra Singh Dhoni**, completed as part of Sheryians Coding School Cohort 2.0.

It visually segments five key aspects of his journey—trophy wins, iconic looks, and career milestones—into a single, cohesive, magazine-style layout using **CSS Grid**.


## 📌 About the Project

The aim of this task was to create a **complex, non-uniform layout** that is both aesthetically pleasing and fully responsive. The design challenges the developer to move beyond standard row-and-column layouts and utilize advanced CSS Grid features to achieve a dynamic collage effect.

The design emphasizes the visual hierarchy of the images and includes subtle interactivity to enhance the tribute.

**Key highlights:**

🖼️ Magazine-style image collage
🌐 Fully responsive using **CSS Grid**
✨ Interactive zoom and shadow on hover
🎨 SCSS-based styling for a clean codebase

## 🎥 Project Preview

Here’s how the grid layout looks:

✨ The layout allows users to view five distinct sections with background images. Each section is styled for clarity and visual appeal, maintaining a clean grid structure.  


## 🚀 Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Grid Layout** | Uses **`grid-template-areas`** for an expressive, readable, and complex grid structure. |
| **Image Arrangement** | Five distinct sections covering different eras and achievements of MS Dhoni. |
| **Hover Effect** | Subtle `scale` and `box-shadow` transitions on hover for a professional, interactive touch. |
| **SCSS Styling** | Clean, modular SCSS with nesting for efficient and targeted styling. |
| **Responsiveness** | Utilizes **fractional units (`fr`)** in the grid definition for inherent adaptability to different screen widths. |


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – Semantic page structure (`<main>`, `<aside>`, `<section>`).
* **SCSS (Sass)** – Styling, hover effects, and transitions.
* **CSS Grid** – The core layout engine responsible for the complex collage structure.


## 📖 Learning Outcome

Through this project, I learned how to:

1.  Master the use of **`grid-template-areas`** to define and manage complex, multi-span layouts in CSS Grid.
2.  Combine responsive units (`fr`) with fixed gaps (`px`) to create a flexible yet precise layout.
3.  Implement **smooth transitions** and transformations (`scale`, `box-shadow`) on hover to add depth to static elements.
4.  Structure SCSS using nesting to keep styles logically grouped with their respective HTML elements.


## 🙌 Acknowledgement

This project was completed as part of **Sheryians Coding School Cohort 2.0**.

The tribute design is inspired by modern editorial and poster layouts, focusing on high-impact visual storytelling achieved entirely through HTML and SCSS.
